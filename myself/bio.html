                Hi, I'm Esteban Sánchez, thanks for stopping by my little space on the web.
                <br>
                <br>
                I'm currently working as a lead data scientist at Bravent. And what got me there was work and perseverance. What I like most about working as a data scientist is the opportunity to work with teams from all over the world and the ability to design and implement solutions based on artificial intelligence that bring this world closer to people and help them in their daily lives.
                <br>
                <br>
                When I was 18 years old I moved from Conil de la frontera (Cádiz) to study what I was passionate about, physics. During my studies I found that beautiful mix between mathematics and natural phenomena that I fell in love with. From then on, I liked mathematics more and more, it is a way of talking to nature and it is an objective language that allows you to see reality in its purest form.
                <br>
                At the end of my degree, during my final project, I was able to find a taste for programming. I loved to see how I could, through a recipe, make a computer do the mathematics I wanted. Thanks to this and my first job opportunity, I was able to specialise in programming and data science.
                <br>
                After graduating, I decided to combine my master's studies in data science with work, while I continued to study aspects of artificial intelligence in a self-taught manner.
                <br>
                <br>
                My desire to continue learning did not stop there. I started a new degree in psychology and a master's degree in complex systems physics. In the end, between the new master's degree and work, I had to give up psychology, although I hope to be able to take it up again at some point. I find it fascinating to learn about human behaviour through the mind and the biological processes that happen to us.
                <br>
                However, I decided to give more weight to the master's degree in complex systems physics. A field, physics and mathematics, that I wanted to continue learning about. Complex systems is a very broad field of study, and that's what I liked the most. Similar mathematical models can be used to explain social or quantum, financial or biological phenomena. This ended up leading me to the study of Twitter hoaxes from a data and graph perspective. 
                <br>
                <br>
                After my master's degree in data science, I wanted to develop myself in a field that had always attracted my attention, namely trading. From a mathematical perspective, I believe that it is a very challenging and complex system that leads to the search for the best strategies to optimise and make a portfolio profitable. That is why since then, when I have free time, I dedicate myself to research on strategies and how artificial intelligence can help to make better decisions.
                <br>
                <br>
                This whole quest to go beyond a phenomenon and try to understand how it works, through mathematics or artificial intelligence, is what has brought me to the place where I am.
                <br>
                <br>
                I am a very proactive person, I like to move fast from words to deeds. I try to be consistent and live by my values, that leads me to be a deep person with a very pronounced inner discourse, it is not easy sometimes to learn about your own incongruities. I like the people around me to be happy and above all I like to transmit what I do, so that the people who listen to me understand me.
                <br>
                <br>
                And last but not least. I like to do sports, I'm a bit of a gym-bro, but I especially like outdoor sports like running or hiking. I would like to say that I read a lot, but I never find the time to read as much as I would like to, the same goes for video games and board games. A plan that includes any kind of these games and I'd be delighted. And finally, I'm a bit of a specialty coffee geek.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Here is a picture of me doing one of the things I like the most, hiking. The photo is from the <strong>Aljibe</strong> peak in the <strong>natural park of Los Alcornocales</strong> in Cádiz.
